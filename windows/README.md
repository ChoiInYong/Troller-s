# Copycat Window

Sample that shows how to use the [window API](http://developer.chrome.com/trunk/apps/app.window.html) to create a window with a custom frame and manipulate its properties.

The app creates two windows, an "original" window and a "copycat" window. The copycat window mimics the position and minimize state of the original window, but it displays itself in an inverted fashion.
